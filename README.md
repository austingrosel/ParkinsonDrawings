# Parkinson Drawings Project

This repository contains my analysis on the sprial drawings dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Disease+Spiral+Drawings+Using+Digitized+Graphics+Tablet). Some exploratory code is featured in this repository while the link to the R Markdown file is below.

The project was to look at the 25 different spiral drawings and try to cluster them based on if a patient had Parkinson's or not. The first part of the problem was to cluster the drawings as best as possible, and the second part of the problem was to see if I could cluster the static vs. dynamic drawings separately. The R Markdown file can be found in this repository and also on the [web](http://rpubs.com/agrosel/359278).
